Hi asdeka2y :)

I'll need your help in sharing it and finding people that can help with the testing with the following criteria:
- Preferably but not necessarily car owners
- Don't mind using the metro or the bus
- Have errands in areas that have metro or bus stations nearby
- Would not mind using the application constantly for a period of 3-4 weeks

Please share with them the following:

I would really appreciate you helping me with my masters thesis. It is titled: "Greenie - Alternative Transportation Means for a more Sustainable Environment through a Serious Game".

What does greenie do?

greenie is an application to help you monitor your transportation and your carbon footprint. The application will give you insight on alternative ways to go to your destination in order to lower your consumption.
The more you decrease your carbon footprint the better your score will be on the website and also in helping the environment. Alongside, you can decrease the time you waste in transportation and the amount of money you spend.
You can also see where you stand amongst other fellow greenies through the leaderboards.
Join and become a greenie! Make this world green again!

The best three greenies will be rewarded ;) Increase your application use, increase your chance to win.

For sign-up, please access: greenie-game.herokuapp.com

Kindly note that the application is in its beta version. For any inquiries and bugs please contact: lydia.sidhom@gmail.com
